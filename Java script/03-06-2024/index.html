    <h1>Callback Methods</h1>
    <h3>What are Callbacks?</h3>
    <p>A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is called after the main function has finished its execution. The main function is called with a callback function as its argument, and when the main function is finished, it calls the callback function to provide a result. Callbacks allow you to handle the results of an asynchronous operation in a non-blocking manner, which means that the program can continue to run while the operation is being executed.</p>
