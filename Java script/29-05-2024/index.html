    <h1>Functions in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, there are several ways to define functions: function expressions, function declarations, and arrow functions. Each has its own syntax, behavior, and use cases. Understanding the differences between these function types is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. </p>
    <h3>Function Declaration:</h3>
    <p>A function declaration defines a named function using the function keyword. It can be used before or after the declaration within the same scope.</p>
    <h3>Function Expression:</h3>
    <p>A function expression is a way to define a function as an expression within an assignment statement. It allows you to create unnamed functions (also known as anonymous functions) or named functions.</p>
    <h3>Arrow Function:</h3>
    <p>Arrow functions are a concise way to write anonymous functions. They have a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions and do not have their own this.</p>
    <h3>Function Parameters and Arguments:</h3>
    <p>Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.
     <br>
        Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.</p>
    <h3>Default Parameters:</h3>
    <p>If a function is called with missing arguments (less than declared), the missing values are set to undefined.</p>
    <h3>Return keyword:</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, the "return" statement is used to specify the value that a function should output or "return" back to the caller. When a return statement is encountered within a function, the function will immediately stop executing, and the specified value will be sent back to the code that called the function.</p>
