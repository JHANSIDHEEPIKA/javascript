    <h2>Primitive Data Types:</h2>
    <P>The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.</P>
    <P>There are 7 types of Primitive Data Types: </P>
    <ul>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Number</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Null</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>BigInt</li>
        <li>NaN</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>String:</h4>
    <p>A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "Jhansi".
    <br>
        Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes</p>
    <h4>Number:</h4>
    <p>All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).
       <br>
        Numbers can be written with, or without decimals</p>
    <h4>Boolean:</h4>
    <p>Booleans can only have two values: true or false.</p>
    <h4>Null:</h4>
    <p>This type has only one value that is null.</p>
    <h4>Undefined:</h4>
    <p>In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.</p>
    <h4>BigInt:</h4>
    <p>All JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format.
    <br>
        JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.</p>
    <h4>NaN:</h4>
    <p>In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number".
    <br>
        In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number.
    <br>   
        The Global NaN property is the same as the Number.Nan property.</p>
    <h2>Non-primitive data types:</h2>
    <p>The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types. It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.</p>
    <P>There are 2 types of Primitive Data Types: </P>
    <ul>
        <li>Object</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Object:</h4>
    <p>JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
    <br>
        Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.</p>
    <h4>Arrays:</h4>
    <p>JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
    <br>
        Array items are separated by commas.</p>
    <h2>Difference between Primitive and Non-Primitive data types:</h2>
    <p>Primitive data structures are simple and predefined types like integers and booleans, used for basic data storage, whereas non-primitive structures like arrays and lists are more complex, designed for organizing collections of data and enabling advanced data manipulation.</p>
    <h2>The typeof Operator:</h2>
    <p>You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
     <br>
        The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.</p>
